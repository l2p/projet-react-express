And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him know the world hadn't ended.Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me."
